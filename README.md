# Now let me briefly introduce the technical architecture and highlights of this application.


# Technical architecture:
# The application is developed using the Flutter framework to achieve cross-platform operation and support Android and iOS.

# SQLite is used for data storage to ensure that the gift data added by users is permanently saved and supports local retrieval and management.

# Images are stored on local devices, reducing reliance on the network and improving loading speed and user experience.

# Integrates the ChatGPT API, which handles chat functionality and returns real-time responses through Web API requests.


# Technical highlights:
# Random gift function: Combined with random data query of SQLite database, it can realize fast and non-duplicate gift recommendation.

# User-defined functions: Visual CRUD operations (create, delete, modify and query) provide users with high flexibility.

# Chatbox integration: Real-time interaction makes the application more intelligent and interesting.
